Rules of Conway’s “Game of Life”
    1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Cellular automata
    * Grid of cells like an array 
    * Each cells 
        Have a state (Live or Dead)
        Have a neighborhood (states determines by its neighbors)
        State = f(neighbor state t-1)

    * Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling.
    * Using simplest form/pattern to predict complex behavior
